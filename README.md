## Customization

### Adding New Plugins
1. Create a new file in `lua/plugins/` with this structure:
```lua
return {
  'author/plugin-name',
  dependencies = { -- optional
    'dependency1',
    'dependency2',
  },
  config = function()
    -- Configuration code here
  end
}
```

### Changing Theme
Edit `lua/plugins/colorscheme.lua` and uncomment your preferred theme configuration.

### Modifying Keymaps
Edit `lua/core/keymaps.lua` - organized by functionality sections for easy navigation.

This configuration is built for productive Python/Django development with quick access to common tasks. All key mappings are logically organized around the space key as leader.
